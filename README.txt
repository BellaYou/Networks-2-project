About:
We hope to design a website that matches groups of students together for projects and to study.
Our website will provide an interface where students can enter their work or study preferences
for a given class, and our matching algorithm will weight the student's preferences and match
him or her with one or more other students with similar preferences. In terms of code, we plan
to implement a website with form functionality in HTML, CSS, and PHP or Javascript.  Our back-end
code for processing the students' input, analyzing and matching students, and potentally persisting
the matches made will be implemented in Python. 
We are also considering implementing a chat interface so that students can communicate with each
other once matched.
